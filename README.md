The objective of the game will be to have $X in the player's bank account by
the end of thirty days. The player will have 16 hours per day (8 hours of sleep
deducted). There will be a few places that they are able to go to: Career
Services (where they will view their job prospects and select a job), Education
Center (where they can further their education to get a better job, also a
possible place of work), Diner (where they must purchase something everyday as a
source of food, also a possible place of work), and the Bank (where they can
deposit their money to keep it from getting stolen, also a possible place of
work). It is similar to the game of Tycoon Jones, but it is simpler. Each place
will be located a certain number of hours from one another which will account
for travel time. If a player does not purchase something from the Diner for a
day, a certain number of hours will be deducted for "recovery" since they did
not 'eat' anything. Each week, the player will need to pay a certain amount of
rent, which will be deducted from their bank account. It is possible for players
to lose their jobs.
