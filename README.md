The objective of the game is to have $4,000 in your bank account by the end of
21 days. There are 16 hours per day (8 hours of sleep deducted). The locations
include:
- the Diner (a possible place of work and a place to buy food, which will
increase happiness)
- the Bank (a possible place of work, the place to deposit
and withdraw money from your bank account, and the place to pay rent)
- Career Services (place to view job prospects and obtain a job)
- Education Center (possible place of work and place to learn in order to obtain
a higher paying job

On Day 7, the player will owe $500 in rent. On Day 14, the player will owe
$1,000 in rent. On Day 21, the player will owe $1,500 in rent. It takes a
certain amount of hours to travel between the places. It is possible for players
to be robbed of the money in their pocket, but the money they put into the bank
is safe. It is also possible to lose your job. The more lottery tickets that are
bought, the better chance of winning there is.
